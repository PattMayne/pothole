## This module only provides a couple of compile-time code to switch between
## Postgres and sqlite. The functions between those two modules are mostly the same
## so you do not have to worry about it for the most part.
## 
## Though, you should check the dbEngine constant. You can simply import this
## module and use check what database engine dbEngine is pointing to at compile
## time
## 
## Do not write code under the assumption that only one database engine will be
## used unless you have configured all your build systems to explicitly use only
## one database.
