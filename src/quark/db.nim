## Database backend for pothole, this engine is powered via postgres
## (more specifically, the standard db_connector/db_postgres module)
## This backend is still not working yet.

# From somewhere in Quark
import private/database

# From somewhere in the standard library
import std/strutils

# Store each column like this: {"COLUMN_NAME":"COLUMN_TYPE"}

# In the past, we used an archaic and sorta messed up system for making
# the tables, these have been replaced with a plain old SQL script that gets read
# at compile-time.
#
# Unlike Pleroma, Pothole's config is entirely stored in the config file.
# There is no way to configure Pothole from the database alone.
# So we do not need a tool to generate SQL for a specific instance.
