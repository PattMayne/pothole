# Contrib

Welcome to our code trashbin. This is code that has been thrown out but that we want to somewhat save later.

Maybe its some useful code that simply is not needed now. Idk, have a look for yourself

Don't expect this code to be high-quality, well, a lot of it is ugly and low-quality which is why it has been thrown out.

You can put anything you want here, this is the `contrib` folder after all. [More info here](https://drewdevault.com/2020/06/06/Add-a-contrib-directory.html)
