# Pothole docs

Documentation and whatnot for Pothole.

This now also houses the static site generations tools, stylesheets, the files used for the homepages and other fun nifty things.

## How do I generate the site?

You will need the following:
* pandoc (For converting markdown to HTML)
* make (For running the build tasks)

To build the entirety of the pothole website, run `make`.

## What has been documented?

From the start, the `DESIGN.md` document has documented most design choice and the rationale behind it plus some interesting stuff. Definitely check it out if you are interested in learning the design choices that are specific to Pothole and why they were made.

Right now, a lot of things remain undocumented. And they are likely to stay that way unfortunately.

## What will be documented? (in the future)

In the future, the following stuff should be documented:

* Setup procedure (From pre-built binaries)
* Setup procedure (Self-compiled from main branch or a tag)
* Styling your user-profile
* How to log on to other frontends (Bloat-fe, Pinafore etc.)

Not to mention, the stuff that has to be done now:

* Documenting the configuration file.
