# Contrib

Hello! This is the contrib folder where anything that is slightly useful is stored. By slightly useful, we mean patches, APIs, code or some other thing that might be useful to some people but it's either unmaintained, low-quality code or both.

This folder has been given a very light review at most but it is unmaintained. You are encouraged to read, test and build the code before you use it in any production system.

Here are examples of what you can store here:
1. A patch or feature that cannot be accepted into the main codebase.
2. Old themes, logos or images.

But of course, these are not rules that are set in stone. You can put whatever you want here. Just please do not file bugs for things stored in this folder.

For legal reasons, if you *do* actually end up storing something here then please add your copyright disclaimer inside of the file (if its source code) or add your name and email to the COPYRIGHT file along with a path to the file and folder that you added like so:

```
Path: /path/to/your/stuff
Description: A small description. Don't go overboard.
Copyright: © Your Name <your@email.example> Current Year
```

Your work here will also be licensed either under the CC-BY 4.0 International license or the GPL (version 3 or later) depending on if it is source code or not. (GPL if code, CC if not), you can optionally choose to supply a License with an SPDX license identifier like so:

```
Path: /path/to/your/stuff
Description: A small description. Don't go overboard.
Copyright: © Your Name <your@email.example> Current Year
License: GPL-3.0-or-later
```
