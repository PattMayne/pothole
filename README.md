# Pothole

A lightweight ActivityPub backend.

## Does it work?

No. You are better off using [Akkoma](https://akkoma.social/) or [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/).

It might be someday in the future more stable, but I am busy with other things and this is made in a programming language I am not very familiar with. So this is the reason why it's not ready yet.

### But I still want to use it

Well then head on to the compilation section, but don't expect it to fully work out-of-the-box, configuration is required.

If I had to give an estimate, i'd say that Pothole is 0.01% towards reaching its goal of being a barely-working lightweight ActivityPub backend.

## Compilation

Pothole is written in Nim, so you'll need the nim compiler and your favorite C compiler (`gcc` and `clang` work pretty well)

Simply run `nimble build` to build Pothole, by default it will build with sane options and be optimized for speed rather than size.

## Running as-is

You can execute `make test` to compile Pothole with debug options and run it instantly. This is more intended for developer testing and it is not recommended for average users. **Note:** This method requires GNU make or any decent `make` implementation.

But if you do not want to install make then you can use the following command to execute and run Pothole as-is: `nim r  -d:release --opt:speed --threads:on --stackTrace:on src/pothole.nim`. `make test` is an alias for that command.
