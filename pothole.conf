# This controls whether or not to enable "federation"
# Federation means to share posts with other servers that speak the same protocol (ActivityPub)
# Disabling this means that posts will not automatically be shared with other servers,
# and that other servers cannot share posts with you or your users.
#
# It is highly recommended that you leave this enabled, unless you're using Pothole
# to serve a private community (such as a forum)
# The default value is true.

# This is the uri that outgoing ActivityPub JSON payloads will be disguised with.
# If you set this, do not change it, otherwise you will break quite a load of stuff.
# Assuming you set this up correctly, this feature will allow you to host a Pothole instance
# on a subdomain, but somehow let you disguise your posts as coming from whatever other
# subdomain you want.
# For example, you can set up your server on ph.example.com and make it so 
# your posts look like they come from @example.com
# 
# This is still unused however.

# Flat storage: Uploads are handled by Pothole's web server, and copied to the folder configured in storage:upload_folder. Set this to "flat" to enable this.
# Remote proxy: Uploads are magically sent to whatever S3-compatible server you configure. (Incomplete) Set this to "remote" and configure the server to enable this feature.

# If it's for a large server or you wanna join a "media proxy collection" then set up Remote proxy.

# Pothole will simply append the media it seeks to the end of whatever URL to add here, so:
# https://media.example.com/pothole/ turns into https://media.example.com/pothole/user_id/media_filename/
