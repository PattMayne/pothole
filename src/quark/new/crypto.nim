# crypto.nim: 
## This module provides password hashing functions, and most importantly, the `KDF` object that is used when processing passwords for users.
## 
## This module also previously provided functions for fetching cryptographically-secure random data such as string, chars and ints but that job has been outsourced to [rng](https://github.com/penguinite/rng.git) in the main Pothole codebase.
## 
## To use KDF and the password hashing functions, you simply use the `hash()` function.
## If a user requires a specific algorithm then you can provide it in the `algo` parameter
runnableExamples:
  var
    password = "Hello World!"
    salt = "SomeRandomSalt"
  
  # Hashing with PBKDF-HMAC-SHA512, 210000 iterations.
  # This is the default algorithm since May 22 2024.
  let hash1 =  hash(password, salt, PBKDF_HMAC_SHA512)

import quark/new/shared

# For password hashing
import nimcrypto, nimcrypto/pbkdf2, std/base64

const kdf* = PBKDF_HMAC_SHA512 ## The latest Key Derivation Function supported by this build of pothole, check out the KDF section in the DESIGN.md document for more information.

proc pbkdf2_hmac_sha512_hash(password, salt:string, iter: int = 210000): string =
  ## We use PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 by default with 210000 iterations unless specified.
  ## This procedure is a wrapper over nimcrypto's PBKDF2 implementation
  ## This procedure returns a base64-encoded string. You can specify the safe parameter of 
  ## encode() with the genSafe parameter
  ## kdf ID: 1
  runnableExamples:
    var password = "cannabis abyss"
    var salt = "__eat_flaming_death"
    # Hash the user's password
    var hashed_password = pbkdf2_hmac_sha512_hash(password, salt)

      sha512,
      toOpenArray(password,0,len(password) - 1),

    var hashed_password = hash(password, salt, PBKDF_HMAC_SHA512)
