# parser.nim  ;;  A procedure to parse Potcode.

## This module provides an easy to use interface
## for the reference implementation of the Potcode parser.
## This module heavily depends on Pothole modules (user, db, post, lib, conf)
## Heavy modifications would be needed to port this somewhere else.
## 
## Ie. it's called "Potcode" for a reason... It's for Pothole :P

## This module is very much W.I.P
