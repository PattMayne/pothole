## Contains functions for inserting, updating and deleting data depending on which engine.
## This is mostly a compile-time wrapper to whatever database backend you use.
## Supported backends include: sqlite and postgres
## To use sqlite, simply supply "-d:useSqlite" to the nimble build command
## To use postgres, simply supply "-d:usePostgres" to the nimble build command.
#

# Note: This code is quite ugly

# Use sqlite in debug target or when user explicitly chooses it.
