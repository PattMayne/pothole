Status: Unsupported

This version was simply pushed because of the libpothole/pothole split. There are no significant finished features in this release.
There is no reason why you should be installing and using this release, so don't.

Still, if you are curious then switch to the `v0.0.2` git tag and run `nimble build`, you will most likely encounter an error, don't bother us about it since we do not support this version anymore whatsoever and we never have.
