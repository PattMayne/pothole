# An example configuration file for Pothole
# Use this as a base for your deployed configuration.

# Note: If you have any double quotes (")in your values then please escape them by backslashing them.

# Warning: Make sure to configure your postgres to have standard_conforming_strings DISABLED
# Otherwise, you will be vulnerable to SQL injections. See https://github.com/nim-lang/db_connector/issues/19
# Ultimately, its up to the nim-lang team to fix this, but I might submit a PR someday.
[db]

# This is the default value
# Using a Unix socket is way faster but that
# maybe requires configuring postgres.
# Just add the unix socket to the host key as-is
# if you want to go that route.
#
# Be aware that potholectl dev db and pothole db docker
# were explicitly designed with TCP/IP in mind, so using unix sockets
# might not be supported for those two commands.

uri="ph.example.com"

# This is the uri that outgoing ActivityPub JSON payloads will be disguised with.
# If you set this, do not change it, otherwise you will break quite a load of stuff.
# Assuming you set this up correctly, this feature will allow you to host a Pothole instance
# on a subdomain, but somehow let you disguise your posts as coming from whatever other
# subdomain you want.
# For example, you can set up your server on ph.example.com and make it so 
# your posts look like they come from @example.com
# 
# This is still unused however.

# will use 3500 by default

# This controls how many posts will be rendered per page for a user profile

[storage]

# Do not store user-generated content here.
static="static/"

# Unused config options

# Pothole supports 2 different storage mechanisms.
# Flat storage: Uploads are handled by Pothole's web server, and copied to the folder configured in storage:upload_folder. Set this to "flat" to enable this.
# Remote proxy: Uploads are magically sent to whatever S3-compatible server you configure. (Incomplete) Set this to "remote" and configure the server to enable this feature.
# Which one is better? Well if it's a server only for you then consider setting up Flat storage *SECURELY*
# If it's for a large server or you wanna join a "media proxy collection" then set up Remote proxy.
type="flat"

# The user uploads directory. Any files uploaded by users will be available here.
# Provided that the storage type is set to flat

# If you have implemented a system such as the one described here: https://webb.spiderden.org/2023/05/26/pleroma-mitigation/
# then you can set this url to the "media server" you have. 
# Pothole will simply append the media it seeks to the end of whatever URL to add here, so:
# https://media.example.com/pothole/ turns into https://media.example.com/pothole/user_id/media_filename/
# If this is not set, then under a default config, Pothole will use the instance:uri option + /media/ like so:
# https://ph.example.com/media/user_id/media_filename/
upload_uri=""

#type="remote"
#upload_server="uh, idk s3?"
# TODO: Finish the S3 stuff.

# This will be appended on top of upload_uri (or instance:uri)
# By default it is default_avatar.webp
