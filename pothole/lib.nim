# lib.nim:
## This module contains shared data across Pothole.
## It also contains useful procedures and functions that are
## used across the app.
## 
## Things like object definitions, string-handling functions
## and debugging functions fit well here but functions that are
## less commonly used or needed should be put elsewhere 
## 
## (Fx. the escape functions for the User and Post objects
##  are rarely used so they are in separate modules.)
## 
## This module is very huge. Please try to put your stuff somewhere else.

# For macro definition
from std/macros import newIdentNode, newDotExpr, strVal

# User data type, which represents actual users in the database.
# Confusingly, "name" means display name and "handle" means
# actual username. It's too late to change this now sadly.
#
# NOTE: If you are going to extend this  type then please
# edit the database schema in the exact order of User.
#
# EXTRA NOTE: If you are going to add a new datatype,
# maybe int for the number of followers, then please
# edit escape() and unescape() from data.nim and also edit
# addUser() and constructUserFromRow() from db.nim
# so they won't error out!
## Here are all of the fields in a user objects, with an explanation:
type 
  User* = ref object
    id*: string # An OID that represents the actual user
    handle*: string # A string containing the user's actual username 
    name*: string # A string containing the user's display name
    local*: bool # A boolean indicating if this user is from this instance 
    email*: string # A string containing the user's email
    bio*: string # A string containing the user's biography
    password*: string # A string to store a hashed + salted password 
    salt*: string # The actual salt with which to hash the password. 
    admin*: bool # A boolean indicating if the user is an admin.
    is_frozen*: bool #  A boolean indicating if the user is frozen/banned. 

# ActivityPub Object/Post
type 
  Post* = ref object
    id*: string # A unique id.
    recipients*: seq[string] # A sequence of recipient's handles.
    sender*: string # Basically, the person sending the message
    replyto*: string # Resource/Post person was replying to,  
    content*: string # The actual content of the post
    written*: string # A timestamp of when the Post was created
    updated*: string # A timestamp of when then Post was last edited

                # came from the local server or external servers
