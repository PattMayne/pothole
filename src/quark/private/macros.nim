  ## A procedure to get a field of an object using a string.
  ## Like so: user.get("local") == user.local

macro autoStmt*(db: DbConn, x: typed, table: static[string], o: object): untyped =
  ## A procedure to magically call db.exec with only a object.
  ## And to have every field escaped by the database layer itself
  ## 
  ## Use it like so:  DATABASE_CONNECTION.autoStmt(OBJECT_TYPE, TABLE_NAME, OBJECT)
  ## So, to insert a user: db.autoStmt(User, "users", user)
