# and create an optimized "Table" (What you would call Dictionary in Python)
# This is most likely faster than storing the config file directly
# in memory
# Our config format only has one key and one value corressponding to that key
# Dictionaries have the exact same format which means we can
# simply provide functions for converting specific data types into different things.
