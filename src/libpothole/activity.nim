# activity.nim
## This provides the type definition for "Activity" objects.
## An Activity is basically something like a Like, Boost or Reply.
## This module provides functions for dealing with said "Activities"
## such as transforming them into sequences that can be fed into other procedures.
## Our object is very similar to ActivityPub's Activities, this is by design.
## And including them in a separate activity.nim module is also by design.
