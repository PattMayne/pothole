This command creates a new post and adds it to the database.
By default, it follows this format: SENDER [REPLYTO] CONTENT
(REPLYTO is optional and can be omitted.)
Here is an example: potholectl post new john "Hello World!"

This command requires that the user's you'll be sending from are real and exist in the database.
Otherwise, you'll be in database hell.
