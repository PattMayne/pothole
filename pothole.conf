[folders]
# The static folder contains CSS, ToS and other fun things.
# These are generated by Pothole on demand and stored in the disk
# So as to save time (assets.load() takes quite a lot of time to process)
# and to save memory, storing static assets inside memory might improve speed 
# but one of my goals is to reduce memory usage for useless thing.
# I want to use memory to optimize requests specifically.
# 
# Anyways, this is optional and Pothole will default to 
# a folder called "static" in the current working directory
# But if you are going to change this then make sure to
# add a slash at the end.
