Welcome to the official website of the Pothole project!

*Note: Pothole is still in its pre-alpha stage, check the [Status section](#status) for more information*

# What is Pothole?{#about}

Pothole is a microblogging server written in Nim, it's designed to be very fast and efficient.
It also allows users to customize their profile using CSS.

Pothole also supports ActivityPub, which means you can talk to other users on Mastodon, Pleroma and Misskey servers.
It also supports Mastodon's API which means your Mastodon clients, frontends and bots should work with little to no changes when migrating to Pothole.

The goal of Pothole is to create a social-media server so simple, so lightweight and so efficient that anyone can set it up, no prior experience required.
This is achieved with simple code but also easily understandable documentation such as this homepage, the wiki and API references.

# Does it work yet?{#status}

Unfortunately no, Pothole is still in its pre-alpha stage and its internal structure will probably change very frequently. Do not use libpothole or pothole for your production server *yet*

When pothole can finally be considered stable (or at least alpha) then this section will be updated accordingly.
