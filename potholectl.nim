# potholectl:
## Potholectl is a command-line tool that provides a nice and simple interface to many of Pothole's internals.
## It can be used to create new users, delete posts, add new MRF policies, setup database containers and more!
## Generally, this command aims to be a Pothole instance administrator's best friend.
