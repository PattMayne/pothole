# parser.nim  ;;  A procedure to parse Potcode.

## This module provides an easy to use interface
## for the reference implementation of the Potcode parser.
## This module heavily depends on data, db and nim and is specifically intended to be used in Pothole.
## Heavy modifications would be needed to port this somewhere else.
## 
## Ie. it's called "Potcode" for a reason... It's for Pothole :P

# The first stage of parsing is 
# getting every command, cleaning it and 
# adding it to a sequence.
# The second stage is basic parsing.
# We replace all the easy parts and then
# We move on to the third step which is semantic/advanced parsing.
# Here we have to deal with loops, blocks and all sorts of crazy things.
# And it is the hardest part of the whole ordeal.
#
# Note: One thing I want to do is kinda make the parser use Nim functions.
# I write various commands as real Nim functions which then get used.
# The only problem is we need a way to synchronise posts inbetween procedures.
# We could pass them together as a part of the command.
#
# Extra note: In the first stage we add each command to a table and replace it
# in memory with a marker, that we can easily replace later on when we are done parsing everything.

# input: A string containing the file to parse. (The actual file's contents)
# user: A User object of the user we are trying to parse for.
# seq[Post]: a sequence of Post objects that can be found in the database.
# context: What we are trying to parse, and what purpose does it serve. Are we parsing a user profile or a user's favorite posts? list.html, error.html or some other file??? user for user.html, error for error.html, list for list.html and post for post.html
