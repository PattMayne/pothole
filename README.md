# Pothole

A lightweight ActivityPub backend.

## Does it work?

No. You are better off using [Akkoma](https://akkoma.social/) or [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/).

It might be someday in the future more stable, but I am busy with other things and this is made in a programming language I am not very familiar with. So this is the reason why it's not ready yet.

### But I still want to use it

Well then head on to the compilation section

## Compilation

## Branches

The nim branch contains my attempt at writing Pothole in Nim. It's good, but I want to do it in Julia
