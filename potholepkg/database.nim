## This module only provides a couple of compile-time code to switch between
## Postgres and sqlite. The functions between those two modules are mostly the same
## so you do not have to worry about it for the most part.
## 
## Though, you should check the dbEngine constant. You can simply import this
## module and use check what database engine dbEngine is pointing to at compile
## time
## 
## Do not write code under the assumption that only one database engine will be
## used unless you have configured all your build systems to explicitly use only
## one database.


const dbEngine* {.strdefine.}: string = "sqlite" ## The dbEngine constant is used to signify what database engine the user wants at compile-time.

when dbEngine == "sqlite":
  import db/sqlite
  export sqlite

when dbEngine == "postgres":
  import db/postgres
  export postgres
