# Game plan when inserting a post:
# Insert the post
# Insert the post content
#
# Game plan when post is edited (text only):
# Create a new "text content" row in the db
# Update any other columns accordingly (Setting latest to false)
# Create a new "post content" row in the db and set it accordingly.
# Update any other attributes accordingly (For example, the client, the modified bool, the recipients, the level)
# 
# Game plan when post is edited (For non-historical types, such as polls):
# Remove existing content row
# Create new one
