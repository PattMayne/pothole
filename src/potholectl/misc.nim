  ## Educational material about IDs

Pothole abstract nearly every single thing into some object with an "id"
Users have IDs and posts have IDs.
So do activities, media attachments, reactions, boosts and so on.

Internally, pothole translates any human-readable data (such as a handle, see `potholectl handles`)
into an id that it can use for manipulation, data retrieval and so on.

This slightly complicates everything but potholectl will try to make an educated guess.
If you do know whether something is an ID or not, then you can use the -i flag to tell potholectl not to double check.
Of course, this differs with every command but it should be possible."""

A handle is basically what pothole calls the "username"
A handle can be as simple as "john" or "john@example.com"
A handle is not the same thing as an email address.
In pothole, the handle is used as a login name and also as a user finding mechanism (for federation)"""

This is not exactly a subsystem but a help entry for people confused by dates in potholectl.
Dates in potholectl are formatted like so: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
This means the following:
  1. 4 numbers for the year, and then a hyphen/dash (-)
  2. 2 numbers for the month, and then a hyphen/dash (-)
  3. 2 numbers for the day, and then a hyphen/dash (-)
  4. A space
  5. 2 numbers for the hour and then a colon (:)
  6. 2 numbers for the minute and then a colon (:)
  7. 2 numbers for the second

Here are examples of dates in this format:
UNIX Epoch starting date: "1970-01-01 00:00:00"
Year 2000 problem date: "1999-12-31 23:59:59"
Year 2038 problem date: "2038-01-19 03:14:07"
Year 2106 problem date: "2106-02-07 06:28:15"
The date this was written: "2024-03-23 13:09:26"

Make sure to wrap the date around with double quotes, that way there won't be any mistakes!"""
